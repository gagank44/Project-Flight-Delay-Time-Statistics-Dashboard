# Flight-Delay-Time-Statistics-Dashboard

# Project Description
The Flight Delay Time Statistics Dashboard is a data visualization application built using Python, Pandas, and Dash. It provides an interactive dashboard to analyze and visualize flight delay statistics based on various factors such as airline carrier, weather conditions, National Airspace System (NAS) delays, security delays, and late aircraft arrivals.

The application reads in a CSV file containing airline data and allows the user to input a specific year. Based on the selected year, the dashboard generates line plots that showcase the average delay times for different airlines across different months of the year, categorized by delay types like carrier delays, weather delays, NAS delays, security delays, and late aircraft delays.

The dashboard aims to provide insights into the performance of airlines and the impact of various factors on flight delays, enabling users to make informed decisions or conduct further analysis.
